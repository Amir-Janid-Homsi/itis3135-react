            <h2>My Awesome Hobby: PC Gaming</h2>

            <p>
            PC gaming is genuinely the ultimate way to play games for me. A lot of people get overwhelmed by all
            the settings and sliders, but I actually enjoy configuring everything and making a game run exactly
            how I want. That applies to retro games too—between emulation, PC ports, and community projects, you
            can customize older titles in ways that weren’t possible on original hardware, and I even hook a CRT
            TV directly to my PC because many 90s games were designed around that display technology. After all
            the setup, I finally sit down and play, and it feels like I’m experiencing the game in the best
            possible way.
            </p>

            <p>
            When I think of PC gaming, I see it as an open platform built around freedom and choice. You can
            decide exactly what settings you run your games at, where you buy them, what hardware you use, and
            even what operating system you prefer—Linux now runs most games out of the box. PC gaming also gives
            you the variety you expect from any platform, from online multiplayer without a subscription to any
            genre you can imagine, all on whatever display you want. And because the PC supports emulation, I can
            legally dump and play the games I own using the tools I prefer, which adds another layer of flexibility
            I really enjoy.
            </p>

            <p>
            Building a computer can be a big barrier for some people, which is why many just buy a pre‑built, but
            I genuinely enjoy putting together part lists and seeing how different components work together. Any
            time a new console launches, I’m immediately curious about how it stacks up against modern PC hardware
            and what design choices the developers made. I love analyzing how console makers and game studios
            optimize their games for specific hardware, and channels like Digital Foundry dive deep into exactly
            that kind of comparison. Following this kind of technical breakdown is a big part of what makes PC
            gaming exciting for me.

            <h2>Who I Am: Amir Homsi</h2>

            <p>
            I’ve been playing on computers in some form since I was about five. I detoured into iPads and iOS
            during the latter half of elementary school, but because Apple locked down so many gaming features,
            I ended up tinkering with those devices the same way I would a computer. Growing up, I watched tons
            of YouTube let’s plays, which helped me explore all kinds of games even though I could only play
            maybe a quarter of them on whatever hardware I had at the time—an Xbox 360 late in its generation,
            a Wii U with mostly Nintendo titles, and older systems that could only run certain retro games. As
            I got older and gained access to better hardware, I finally got to play more games than I watched,
            and now I try to play—or at least form an opinion on—as many games as I can.
            </p>

            <p>
            It took me a surprisingly long time to realize that computer science was the field I’d been orbiting
            my whole life. The childhood dream of game development, jailbreaking my iPad, and homebrewing my 2DS
            were all connected, but the wires didn’t click until middle school, when I finally learned that being
            a doctor was nothing like the three video games that made it look fun. Once I turned my attention
            toward computers directly, they stopped being just the middleman for entertainment and became the
            entertainment themselves. Sometimes I wonder how much deeper into this hobby I would’ve gone if I had
            figured it out earlier—would I be some kind of super‑genius by now???
            </p>

            <p>
            I decided to study computer science at UNCC mostly because it was affordable and close to home, not
            because of some dramatic lifelong dream. Even so, I’ve learned a lot here—especially compared to high
            school, where most classes felt like a snooze fest except for math and a few odd exceptions. I’m
            naturally curious and inquisitive, so sometimes I wonder how much further along I’d be if I’d had real
            CS classes earlier, maybe even enough to land a job in this chaotic job market already. And for the
            record, if any employer ever reads this, my lack of club involvement isn’t because I couldn’t be
            bothered—there just wasn’t a group that felt like the right place for me, and I would’ve absolutely
            killed it if there had been.

            <h2>When I Dive Into PC Gaming</h2>

            <p>
            I used to play for hours every day, especially back in middle school. Nowadays there are plenty of
            days where I don’t play a single game, and that honestly saddens me a bit. But I’m also glad I respect
            gaming enough to want each session to feel complete, not something that gets arbitrarily cut short.
            I try to play only when I feel I can give whatever game I’m in the middle of the attention it deserves.
            </p>

            <p>
            I also pick the right kind of game for the time I have and where I am in life. I can’t grind an Elden
            Ring boss if I’m lying in bed or sitting in a waiting room, but I can play something like Metroid or
            Silksong in those moments. I make time to play with friends too, and that usually creates a safe,
            dedicated block of time where the game gets my full attention. Some games even feel like they require
            a specific controller, especially retro ones, and I won’t play them unless I have the right setup.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are also stretches where I don’t end up gaming, but it’s never because I need time away from
            screens — my mind is basically flipped from people who feel that way. Sometimes I play because it
            fits into a routine my mind is stuck in, even outside of being productive; booting a game or beating
            a small section can feel like a tiny goal I set for myself. Other times I’m just not in the right
            headspace for a specific game, and I wait until the moment feels right to return. When I do come back,
            it feels intentional, like I picked the exact time that makes the experience feel satisfying instead
            of rushed.

            <h2>Where Can I PC Game?</h2>

            <p>
            I usually play games at my desk, because that’s my battle station — if that wasn’t my go‑to spot,
            something would be seriously wrong. But sometimes I want to play in bed, and that’s where my Steam
            Deck comes in (my little brother sold it to me, and the little fool still regrets it). It’s a Linux
            PC with the best controller known to man attached to both sides, which means I can even tinker with
            it like a real PC, just on the go. I very occasionally play on original hardware too, and honestly
            the last time I felt the need was Mother 3, since its music‑based battle system only avoids lag on
            the real thing. Even then, my 2DS is allegedly less laggy than a real GBA, but hunting down a GBA
            plus a pirated English‑patched copy isn’t worth the trouble.
            </p>

            <p>
            I don’t think of my desk as the “real” way to game — I just like playing each game in what I consider
            its ideal setup. But sometimes I want to play a game just a bit more than I want to experience it in
            the perfect way on my desktop PC, so I weigh the options and pick whatever space makes sense in that
            moment. I don’t do couch gaming at all, and if I leave my room it’s never for gaming (unless I’m at
            a computer store, but that doesn’t count). Gaming outside my room does happen, but only as a way to
            pass time — I’m not completely stuck in my room, even if that might be a fun life. Maybe I’d be more
            open to the idea if I had a nice TV in my room, but for now everything stays in my little ecosystem
            of desk, bed, and handheld.
            </p>

            <p>
            My room is also where I get excited about the future of how I’ll play. I can’t wait for the new Steam
            Controller — I’ve been using my Steam Deck as a controller for over a year now while waiting for Valve
            to finally make the controller they’ve clearly always wanted to build. Steam Input has completely
            changed how I game, and it’s wild how gyro aim has made my mouse feel obsolete in most games. And once
            Linux PSVR2 support gets ironed out, I want to dive back into VR and feel that higher level of immersion
            again. If the drivers still aren’t finished in a year, I’ll cave and run it through a Windows 11 VM,
            but either way, all of that tinkering and experimenting is something that only really happens in my
            room — it’s the space where my setup evolves.

            <h2>How Can I PC Game?</h2>

            <p>
            PC gaming, for me, is about finding the way a game should feel — not proving a point, not being
            different, and definitely not joining the endless “best input method” debates. I refine my setups
            because I genuinely enjoy making games play better, not because I’m trying to escape the norm. Steam
            Input didn’t just change how I play; it felt like the natural evolution of controls, the moment
            everything finally clicked into place. Gyro aim gives me a level of precision and comfort that feels
            right for me, just like mouse and keyboard feels right for others. And honestly, both sides can get
            weirdly defensive — controller players and mouse players alike — when it should really be a conversation
            about making gaming more accessible, more flexible, and more enjoyable for everyone. The fun part is
            perfecting the control scheme, dialing in the settings, and shaping the experience so each game plays
            the way it deserves to.
            </p>

            <p>
            When I start a game, I usually reach for my Steam Deck‑as‑a‑controller unless the game is built around
            the mouse, like point‑and‑clicks. If a game is d‑pad centric — mostly 2D stuff — I grab my Super
            Nintendo controller, even if that means getting creative to make it work. My choices always come down
            to a mix of precision, comfort, immersion, and what the game actually demands. A controller (with gyro,
                                                                                                         to me at least) often feels more immersive because it’s more expressive and precise, and the fact that
                                                                                                         so many shooters pair stick‑only camera controls with heavy aim assist says a lot about the limitations
                                                                                                         of that input method. Steam Input is where everything comes together: I tweak every game, I refine every
                                                                                                         layout, and even though I have loose templates for certain genres, it always takes playtesting to get it
                                                                                                         perfect — and I love that process. My desktop is usually the best place to play, but some games deserve
                                                                                                         the comfort of my bed or the convenience of being a passtime between things, which is where the Steam
                                                                                                         Deck shines as a handheld. Original hardware is reserved for rare edge cases like Mother 3, where timing
                                                                                                         or latency actually matters. And VR is something I see as the future — maybe even the standard one day —
                                                                                                         but right now it’s more of an experimental glimpse at what full sensory immersion could be. If I ever get
                                                                                                         frustrated at a game for not supporting my controller properly, it’s only because I know the fix wouldn’t
                                                                                                         take much work, and the experience could be so much better for everyone.
                                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                         At the end of the day, the way I play is shaped by a simple idea: PC gaming gives you the freedom to
                                                                                                         make every game feel better than it did by default. It’s not about choosing sides or arguing over which
                                                                                                         input method is “correct,” because every method has strengths and weaknesses, and every player values
                                                                                                         different things. What matters to me is that the tools exist to refine the experience — to make controls
                                                                                                         more expressive, to make movement feel natural, to make aiming feel intuitive, to make the whole thing
                                                                                                         more immersive. Steam Input, gyro, handheld play, original hardware, VR… they’re all just different ways
                                                                                                         of reaching the same goal: shaping the game so it plays the way it should. And when a game doesn’t support
                                                                                                         that level of refinement, it’s frustrating not because I’m picky, but because I know how little it would
                                                                                                         take to elevate the experience for everyone. PC gaming is at its best when it embraces flexibility,
            experimentation, and the idea that players should be able to interact with games in the way that feels
            right to them — not the way tradition says they should.

            {/* WHY */}
            <section className={activeSection === "why" ? "active" : ""} id="why">
            <h2>Why PC Gaming?</h2>

            <p>
            PC gaming is the closest thing gaming has to being truly open source. The entire world quietly runs on
            open‑source software, and most people don’t realize just how much of everything they use depends on it.
            I love PC gaming because it shares that same spirit—when a hobby is open, people can build wild, creative
            things that would never exist in a locked‑down ecosystem. Imagine if every CG asset in your favorite
            action movie were available for cheap or even free, or if you could build an original car from parts sold
            by BMW, Toyota, or even Ferrari; that’s the kind of possibility openness creates.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another reason I care so much about PC gaming is that there’s always one layer deeper—there’s always more
            to the story. Any time I tweak a setting, mod a game, or fix something that breaks, it usually confuses me
            at first, but I often end up learning how all these pieces manage to play nice… or sometimes don’t. It’s a
            hobby that gets better the more you do it, and honestly, it even improves passively over time just by being
            around it.
            </p>

            <p>
            I also care about PC gaming because it’s one of the few hobbies that actually grows with you instead of
            aging out (the RAM prices will go down, high framerates and resolutions will become affordable, just have
            faith!). The games I played as a kid still run today—sometimes better than ever—and the hardware I use now
            will still matter years from now in some form. There’s something comforting about a hobby that I’ll fight
            to keep around, one that doesn’t vanish when the trend cycle moves on but keeps expanding, layering new
            experiences on top of old ones without replacing them.
